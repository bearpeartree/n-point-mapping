# n point gene mapping
- input: .txt file, refer to the examples for structuring your data
- output: right now only the order of genes read from left to right on the chromosome (given one chromosome is laid out horizontally).


# How to use
- Clone this repo
- Save your .txt file in the "inputs" directory
- Execute the program with python3 main.py
- Once the program asks for your filename, just enter the filename (just the name; no directories or anything else)

I have already placed an example file in the "inputs" directory. Just use this file if you want to understand more the workflow of this program.
